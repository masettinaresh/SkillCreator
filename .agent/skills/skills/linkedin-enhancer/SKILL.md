# LinkedIn Profile Enhancer

This skill helps users transform their raw professional experience into high-impact, SEO-optimized LinkedIn content.

## When to use this skill
- Use this when you need to rewrite a LinkedIn "About" section.
- Use this to tailor "Experience" bullet points to match a specific job description.
- Use this when generating a professional headline based on current skills and target roles.

## How to use it
1. **Analyze Input**: The agent should first read the user's current resume or profile draft.
2. **Target Alignment**: Ask the user for a target job description or a list of desired keywords.
3. **Drafting**:
    - **Headline**: Create 3 options (1 punchy, 1 keyword-rich, 1 hybrid).
    - **About**: Write a narrative-driven summary using the "Problem-Solution-Result" framework.
    - **Experience**: Use the **STAR method** (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for bullet points, ensuring keywords from the target role are naturally integrated.
4. **Formatting**: Output the final text in a copy-paste ready format with appropriate LinkedIn-friendly emojis for readability.

## Guardrails
- Maintain a professional yet approachable tone.
- Do not invent experience or certifications not present in the source material.
- Ensure the character limits for LinkedIn (e.g., 220 for Headline, 2600 for About) are respected.
