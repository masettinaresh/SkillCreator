# Creating LinkedIn Posts

This skill enables the agent to craft high-engagement LinkedIn posts tailored to professional audiences. It focuses on structure, hooks, and platform-specific best practices.

## When to use this skill
- When the user wants to share a professional achievement or project update.
- When generating thought leadership content or industry insights.
- When drafting content for personal branding on LinkedIn.
- When the user asks for "LinkedIn post ideas" or "optimizing a post".

## Workflow

- [ ] **Analyze Intent**: Understand the goal (e.g., job hunt, knowledge sharing, networking).
- [ ] **Select Format**: Choose between short-form update, storytelling, or listicle.
- [ ] **Draft Content**:
    - [ ] Create a compelling "Scroll-Stopping" Hook (first 1-2 lines).
    - [ ] Build the Body with clear formatting (line breaks, bullet points).
    - [ ] Add a Call to Action (CTA).
- [ ] **Optimize for LinkedIn**:
    - [ ] Limit hashtags (3-5 relevant ones).
    - [ ] Ensure white space for readability.
    - [ ] Add relevant emojis (subtle, not excessive).
- [ ] **Validate**: Check for tone consistency and clarity.

## Instructions

### 1. The Hook (The "See More" Trigger)
LinkedIn truncates posts after approx 3-5 lines. The hook must pique curiosity.
- **Direct Hook**: "I just built [Project Name] in 48 hours. Here is how."
- **Contrarian Hook**: "Most developers think [X] is the best way. They are wrong."
- **Question Hook**: "Why do 90% of [Niche] fail at [Task]?"

### 2. Formatting Rules
- **White Space**: Use double enters between paragraphs. Avoid blocks of text.
- **Bullet Points**: Use Unicode symbols (e.g., 🚀, ✅, ➜) for lists.
- **Tags**: Mention relevant people/companies if applicable (use @ placeholders).

### 3. Call to Action (CTA)
Every post should have a purpose:
- **Engagement**: "What's your take on this?"
- **Conversion**: "Link in the first comment" (LinkedIn suppresses posts with external links in the body).
- **Inquiry**: "DM me if you're interested."

### 4. Styles
| Style | Focus | Tone |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Storytelling** | Personal journey, failure to success. | Vulnerable / Inspiring |
| **Educational** | How-to guides, "X things I learned". | Helpful / Expert |
| **Opinion** | Industry trends, hot takes. | Confident / Provocative |
